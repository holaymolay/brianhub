# Repository Agents (Binding)

This document is a binding constraint for work in this repository.

## Canonical governance
- Canonical AGENTS live at `.ceres/core/AGENTS.md`.
- Do not modify or shadow Core governance files.

## Active agent expectations
- Use the Execution agent behavior for code changes (tool use allowed).
- Follow CERES PDCA, single‑concept‑per‑commit, and prompt‑artifact workflows.
- Keep scope tight; if work spans multiple concepts, split into separate commits.
- Push each commit to GitHub promptly; do not leave local-only changes beyond the current session unless explicitly requested.
- Update `.ceres/workspace/completed.md` and `.ceres/workspace/handover.md` after work.

## Allowed patterns
- planning (when needed for multi‑step work)
- tool‑use (default for code changes)
- reflection (for reviews only)
